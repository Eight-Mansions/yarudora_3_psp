About Sampaguita
======================================================

A. Project History:

Project originally started alongside Double Cast and
Sampaguita back in the mid-2010s. Was left on the
backburner for some years before coming back to it
in a script rewrite in mid-2023.

We're releasing this as a 0.95, but playtesters were
able to see all endings, and any bugs they found along
the way were fixed as we approached them. All that is
left is the audio cues during the endings which you can
see below for. If you run into any issues while playing
the game for yourself, please let us know!


B. Content Warnings:

Extremely light compared to the other games in the
series. Very mild violent at best.
The main heroine, Maria, is sexualized by the main
character. He can easily harass her in the beginning
of the game. In other scenes, she does get struck
by a male character. All this, given her situation as
a minority in blatant distress could make this game
a little upsetting for the space some players are
trying to curate for themselves and their friends/
viewership. 

The game touches on a lot of language, trivia and
charicatures of people from the Phillipines, so
some segments could be seen as sensationalist,
stereotypical and a bit racist/microaggressive.
For example: there's a segment where the protagonist
can and is rewarded for mocking Maria when she
attempts to teach him different words in Tagalog.

About Percent Completion Messages:

Throughout the gameÅfs ending result screens,
Maria will audibly read out your percentage rates
and give words of encouragement.

There is no text to accompany this, and it was never
really in our plan to add subtitles. To compensate,
IÅfve gone ahead and jotted down some brisk scripts for
a few of the integral ones. These aren't spoilerific
in themselves, but to avoid spoilers, I redacted
secondary character names after Maria.

a. 70% Message:

Maria: Congratulations! This is the 70% mark!
But thereÅfs still more fun to be had.

b. 80% Message:

Wow! This is the 80% mark! ItÅfll be tough from here on out,
but donÅft give up, okay?

[Other character]: But 80%, huh. ThatÅfs nothing to sneeze at!
Good luck! Just a little more!

c. 90% Message:

Maria: Amazing! This is the 90% mark! You almost have it. Now break a leg!

[Other character]: 90%?! ThatÅfs great! But the rest wonÅft be so easyˇ

d. 100% Message:

Maria: Salamat! Fancy seeing you here! This is the 100% mark! 

[Other character]: You came a long way. Thank you, sincerely. 

Maria: I believed in you. I just knew youÅfd make it here!
DonÅft forget about me out there, okay?

C. A Word From Fianna, Playtester:

This was my second time helping playtest a translation, and while I'd
felt more prepared going into Sampaguita, I soon realized just how deep
and complicated a web it weaves. I also learned the sheer depth of talent
and effort put forth by the team on this translation, and have the utmost
respect and appreciation for them and their work on this wonderful release.

For those of you looking to get that precious 100%, I'll leave you with
the advice I wish I'd had going into playtesting: best of luck. Pace yourself
and enjoy the journey, but take notes, draw diagrams, and do whatever you need
to find that one scene with a couple words different from a scene you saw hours
ago that turns out to be that missing hundredth of a percentile point you need.

D. A Word From Emi, Playtester:

Thanks so much for checking out Sampaguita! When I first signed on to playtest
this game, I don't think I was even slightly prepared for how ambitious it truly
is. Though it's a short, breezy game on paper, there's so many fascinating, fun
routes and diversions to find if you really dig into it, with countless scenes
that I had an absolute blast playing through. It's such a cool throwback to a time
when console exclusives could really commit to wild, daring, experimental ideas.
Even now, there's nothing quite like the Yarudora series, and I'm truly honored
to have played even a small part in bringing it to English-speaking players. 

I hope you enjoy it even half as much as I did! Best of luck getting a 100% clear!
